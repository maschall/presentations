### Review thus far
__i__ and __g__ - case insensitive and global matching

__(abc)__ - group matches "abc"
__(ab|bc)__ - group matching "ab" or "bc" 

--
### Review thus far
__.__ - matches all characters  
__[a-z]__ - match a set of characters

__\\b__, __\\w__, __\\d__, __\\s__ - convenient shorthand
__\\.__, __\\\\__, __\\[__, __\\)__ - escape special characters
--
### Review thus far
__+__ -  1 or more
__*__ - 0 or more
__?__ - 0 or 1
__{2,5}__ - at least 2 but no more than 5
--
### Questions?
--
### But wait theres more
So far we've only talked about testing for existance, now let's find things!
--
### Phone number example
/\d{3}-?\d{3}-?\d{4}/g - proves existance of a phone number
--
### But what is that phone number
Match - the individual result of a regex

/\d{3}-?\d{3}-?\d{4}/g

"You can call my cell __5555555555__ or my home __555-555-5555__ at any time"

Match #1: 5555555555  
Match #2: 555-555-5555
--
### Get phone number with label
/cell \d{3}-?\d{3}-?\d{4}/g

"You can call my __cell 5555555555__ or my home 555-555-5555 at any time"

Match: cell 5555555555
--
### Use groups
/cell (\d{3}-?\d{3}-?\d{4})/g

"You can call my __cell 5555555555__ or my home 555-555-5555 at any time"

Match: cell 5555555555
Group 1: 5555555555
--
### Group 0
/cell (\d{3}-?\d{3}-?\d{4})/g

"You can call my __cell 5555555555__ or my home 555-555-5555 at any time"

Match: cell 5555555555
Group 1: 5555555555
Group 0: cell 5555555555
--
### Combined groups
/cell ((\d{3})-?\d{3}-?\d{4})(.*)/g

"You can call my __cell 3135555555 or my home 555-555-5555 at any time__"

Group 1: 3135555555
Group 2: 313

### Named groups*
/cell ((?<areaCode>\d{3})-?\d{3}-?\d{4})/g

"You can call my __cell 3135555555__ or my home 555-555-5555 at any time"

Group 1: 3135555555
Group 2: 313
Group areaCode: 313

_* named groups aren't supported on every platform_
--
### Ignore group (non-capturing group)
/cell (__?:__(\d{3})-?\d{3}-?\d{4})/g

"You can call my __cell 3135555555__ or my home 555-555-5555 at any time"

Group 1: 313
--
### Postive lookahead
__(?=abc)__

/\d{3}-?\d{3}-?\d{4}(?= x\d+)/g

"Work: __313-555-5555__ x345, Home: 248-555-5555"

Match: 313-555-5555
